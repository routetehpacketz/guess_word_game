# Guess the Word game

To learn a bit of C# and Windows Forms, I decided to use part of my holiday vacation recreating a popular mobile word-guessing game in .NET Framework.

Upon startup, the game randomly selects a 5-letter secret word from a built-in word list of over 3,200 words. Similar to the original version of the game, it hightlights letters green if they were guessed in the correct position or highlights them orange if they are found in the secret word.
